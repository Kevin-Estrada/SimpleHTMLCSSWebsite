				<h2>A Little Bit About Me!</h2>
				<p>
					I am a Systems Engineer graduate from Texas A&M International
					University (i.e. TAMIU). I graduated during the 2019 fall year.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am aspiring to become a software developer or software engineer! I
					am not too sure yet in what aspect, for example, front-end, back-end,
					full-stack, etc... I am still trying to learn a lot of the basics in
					different languages such as Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python.
					In addition, I am also trying to look and link some
					frameworks/libraries and Databases into my work such as Bootstrap,
					React, Spring, SpringBoot, MySql, NodeJs and a few others. It is a
					whole learning process for me and definitely difficult, but I am
					having fun learning and always willing to learn with great guidance!
				</p>
				<p>
                    Some of the work experience that I have, which are related and non-related to my aspirations include the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Associate Consultant | Capgemini | 1 Year(Current) </li>
                        <li>Project Configuration Intern | United States Department of Energy | 4 Months</li>
                        <li>Undergraduate Research Assistant | TAMIU | 9 Months</li>
                        <li>Lyft Driver | Lyft | 4 Months</li>
                        <li>Recreational Sports Associate | TAMIU | 8 Months</li>
                    </ul>

					Continously trying to imporve myself on a day basis, even if it is by
					a step or half a step... I will be better than I was yesterday and the
					day before!
