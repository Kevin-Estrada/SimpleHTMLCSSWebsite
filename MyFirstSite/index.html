                <h1>My First Web Page</h1>
                <h2>It may be basic, but I am still learning! :)</h2>

                <p>
                    This simple static website is mostly an attempt to create a simple website that I can host in Github
                    which will only show my skills in learning HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as this simple project goes, I will have some basic CSS and HTML incorporations that will
                    eventually get better as the time goes and anyone can actually track the changes to this website on
                    <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Estrada/SimpleHTMLCSSWebsite">My own Github Repo!</a>
                    Keep in mind that the repo is going to have almost a changing folders of websites, it will be marked
                    as the following below:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MyFirstWebsite</li>
                    <li>MySecondWebsite</li>
                    <li>MyThirdWebsite</li>
                    <li>ETC...</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <aside>
                <h3>By the way...</h3>
                <p>
                    This will also include a quick little page section about myself as well as my contact information!
                    So you an also check out those links above!
                </p>
                <p>
                    And one more note! This website isn't responsive... yet, but I will be working through all of this
                    to continously get better at these concepts.
                </p>
            </aside>
        </div>
        <div id="moveBoxLeft">
            <footer>
                <p>
                    Continously trying to imporve myself on a day basis, even if it is by a step or half a step... I
                    will be better than I was yesterday and the day before!
